this repo is meant for creating a playbook that calls a collection from the private automation hub.
- once i am able to run this playbook from tower I will look to automate the update of the role in the collection using this folder

update:
- was able to pull a collection from private AH and run it in tower.
- next step is to use redhat-cop/ah_configuration/roles/publish role to publish collections to automatoin hub
